    "This project works with the script of the pilot episode of Orange is the New Black. Using regular expressions, I take the script and identify instances of character names, as well as lines of dialogue, and then enter this information into a pandas database. After identifying all of the lines of dialogue, I preprocess all of the lines, and run sentiment analysis as well as part of speech tagging. Finally, using part of speech tagging and vocabulary as features, I use multiple logistical regression models to classify each line of dialogue as holding positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. "

    "It appears that, while all three distributions are significantly right-skewed, their center and spreads differ. The distribution of neutral sentiments has a higher peak closer to 0, and its maximum is 40 tokens––much less than that of the other two distributions. Although we stripped our phrases of most stop words, it still appears that it may take a longer sentence length in order to indicate sentiment. It is worth noting that the negative sentiment distribution has both the smallest peak and largest spread out of all three distributions (std of 15.58)."

    "Another consideration in our classifier is the distribution of compound sentiment scores. Despite its spread, the distribution has one singular, very tall peak directly in the center of its distribution. Such a peak makes me question exactly how we should divide the sentiment classes into qualitative categories. If a line of dialogue is marked as 'positive' or 'negative', yet its score is still quite close to the center, it may be more difficult for our classifier to interpret."
